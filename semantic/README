To make the symbol table demo program:

   make depend-symbtest
   make symbtest                or symbtest.exe (if in Windows)

To make your compiler:

   1. Add your lexer (Lexer.mll, Lexer.mli) and parser (Parser.mly) files
   2. Add any other files that you have and add them to the Makefile
   3. Finally:

   make depend
   make
